# Unlike Michelin-Guide Cuisine, Venture Capital Scales

**TL;DR: Venture capital, as plenty of other businesses, can scale beyond traditional constraints such as time and space. In spite of the status quo, investors making "too many deals" can add a lot of value.**

Every single time I ask an entrepreneur why they are picking us or anybody else as their investors, I get a very similar answer, "it's because of the value-add you bring to the table", and they are right. I agree with the broad idea that there's some value an investor can bring on top of their check book. However, I believe most people in the startup world are misguided about how that value is delivered.

At 500, people are always asking why do we make so many investments, usually implying that we are participating in way too many deals. The compulsory follow up question is how can we add value to so many investments if our time is so limited? Seriously, how is it possible to add value to 450+ companies, and counting, with just over 10 people in the investment team? This rather poignant question is what botters me most and at the same time what makes me more excited about our future.

It's funny how we play in one of the very few industries where people ask this question. One would never ask a restaurant owner or a retailer why do they have so many customers? And well, we don't do so because we're all familiar with the concept of scalable and repeatable processes. When we think about a restaurant having too many customers, we understand that it's because they should be magnificent. As long as food is still as good, waiters are nice and the space is enjoyable, we wouldn't complain because they are serving too many people (except if we're hipsters but that's a different story). It's widely known that there are multiple ways a company can scale without necesasarily having the chef welcome every single customer, show them the menu and prepare every dish directly. In short, we are familiar with the concept of processes and staffing. Moreso, we understand that chefs can transfer their knowledge and even create branches of a whole franchise.

In short, we understand the underlying mechanics of scale. This happens even in a much clearer fashion in tech businesses. We praise Google, Amazon, eBay or you name it for being highly scaleble. Who would argue Apple doesn't add real value because they have less than 10,000 people on staff and serve more than 100,000,000 customers? 

This is the reason why the question about 500 investing in so many startups bothers me. Why do people assume there's a way to scale a retail, financial, manufacturing or health business while there is no way a venture capital firm can do the same? Isn't technology applicable here, too? Aren't there processes one can put in place to make the system more efficient? Can't good marketing practices help? Then why on Earth people think investment firms should be run as boutique mom and pop shops? Why is it that most VCs (and other players) equate value to time spent in front of founders?

The answer is that most VCs perpetuate the perverse idea that personal attention is key, but despite delusions of grandeur, (most) investors aren't blue ribbon chefs. During decades, whole generations in our industry have been acting as if that they were Jiro Ono, Magnus Nilsson or Ferran Adrià. They've made sure we believe that the *only* way to eat good food is to go directly to them, not before competing against many others for the very few tables they can serve every night. I mean, I love Jiro but my industry colleagues must be dellusional to believe this is how *the entire* industry most work.

Professional investors compete to back the most talented people pursuing some of the most ambitious businesses, and while they certainly control where the money goes, they still need to prove entrepreneurs that their dollars are more valuable than their competitor's. Venture capitalists invented terms such as "smart money", "value add" and "partner time" to prevent people like you and me from taking their money at face value.

While it's true that face time is a nice thing to value, there are many other things a good investor can bring to the table, \*cough\* \*cough\* especially in the times of the Internet. 

## Branding

An investor can lend a personal or business brand. It's not the same to go around saying Ashton Kutcher wrote you a check for $10,000 dollars than saying I did the same from $100,000. This value has nothing to do with time. Mr. Kutcher wouldn't have to spend lots of time with every single company in his portfolio to keep building a strong brand. He might as well do, but I'm sure this time shared with founders serves larger purposes such as friendship. 

## Family

When a firm does 200+ deals a year, we can count on a substantially larger family for almost anything. Oh man, we can *actually* message each other over the Internet and sometimers even grab beer with each other. Isn't that amazing? A large network of peers is what makes YC or Techstars, such great programs. This matters more as time goes by. When you turn 40, you'll be glad you became friends with a larger group of fellows. Same thing when you try to expand your business to other regions or get into new market segments.

Very few things feel better than saying "Hey, you should talk to Jane at Startup X, they are a portfolio company and the founders she's quite friendly and knowledgeable. Email her directly and tell put 500 in the subject".

## Cross-pollination

Each company adds their own ups and downs to the combined knowledge of the network. We get smarter as we participate in more deals. Our organization holds the combined lessons of hundreds of companies that have gone through literally thousands of ups and downs. What some will discover, other will use as preentive knowledge. We become giants by standing on the shoulders of hundreds of midgets.

## Partnerships

With scale comes visibility and attention from potential partners. At 500, we work with dozens of small and large companies that are more than happy to sponsor our activities and provide benefits to our companies. Although they would likely do it anyway, they will make a special effort to please larger groups than smaller one.

## Functional support

At scale, its easier to help companies with very clear challenges. Some investment firms will offer access to marketing, tech, finance, public relations or even legal staff. These are all activities that almost every company needs, but especially when they're still small it's difficult to hire have such a comprehensive full time staff. This is something other like Andreesen Horowitz and Google Ventures are doing much better than us and we salute them. 

**Additional note to the entrepreneur:** If you really want the venture capital equivalent of a Michelin 3-star experience. make sure you pick one of the maybe 10 people in the world who can provide it. \*Wink\* \*wink\*, we are not in the list.
