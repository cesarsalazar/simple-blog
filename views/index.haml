  %h2 If I ever turn out to be a great investor, blame it on my designer soul
  :markdown
    I'm a Venture Partner at 500 Startups extending our realm to Mexico and Latin American through Mexican.VC, an accelerator I co-founded. 

    Ever since I started my first company at age 17, I've worked with some of the most talented entrepreneurs, hackers and designers building products of all sorts. Underneath the investor skin, lives a passionate interaction designer with a lousily earned engineering degree who really likes to mess with code (Ruby and CoffeeScript are my current favorites). 

    I also co-founded Hackspedition and StartupDojo, helped jumpstart SuperHappyDevHouse in my home country and advise Startup Weekend Mexico.

    In the end, I'm just a naïve yet passionate guy always pursuing new adventures.
