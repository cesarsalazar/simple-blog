    I'm a Venture Partner at 500 Startups. My awesome job is to find the best tech entrepreneurs in Mexico and Latin America, and help them build successful businesses.

    I started my first company when I was 17. Ever since, I've worked with very talented entrepreneurs, hackers and designers in all sorts of tech products.

    However, the work I'm most proud of is my contribution to the Mexican tech entrepreneurship scene. Through iniatives such as Mexican.VC, Startup Weekend, SuperHappyDevHouse, Hackspedition, Sandbox Network, Chihuahua 320, StartupDojo and some others, I've helped shape some amazing communities of changemakers from the ground up. 

    In the end, I'm just a tireless, curious and passionate guy striving to make his own dent in the universe.
